# Horse Race
Simple game written in python that simulates a horse race and allows the player to bet on a horse.

# Instructions
Just download the ZIP file, extract it and run HorseRace.py from the terminal with
```
$ python3 HorseRace.py
```
From there, just follow the instructions on screen and you will be good to go!

If there are any missing libraries (very unlikely, since the game only uses a couple), you can install them with:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
